            <p>"You speak of peace as if it were a gift the strong can hand down to the weak… but you do not understand the weight of suffering that forges true change. Pain is the language all men understand, the single force that cuts through arrogance, pride, and lies. Through pain, the world remembers what it has forgotten—that every choice bleeds into another, every life is tied to the cost of another. I am not a villain. I am the inevitable truth you refuse to see. To know peace… you must first endure despair. Only when the world feels pain will it finally awaken."</p>
